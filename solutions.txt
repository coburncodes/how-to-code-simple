Problem 0:
    Assume that the two short sides of a right triangle have length 3 and 4.
    What is the length of the long side? Recall that the Pythagorean Theorem
    tells us that: 
        (find the hypotenuse of a 3/4/? right triangle)
    Write a BSL expression that produces the the value of ? for this triangle 
    where the other two sides have lengths 3 and 4.

    Solution 0:
        (sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4)))

Problem 1 (More Arithmetic Expressions):
    Write two expressions that multiply the numbers 3, 5 and 7. 
    The first should take advantage of the fact that * can accept more than 2 arguments. 
    The second should build up the result by first multiplying 3 times 5 and then 
    multiply the result of that by 7. 

    Solution 1:
        (* 3 5 7)
        (* (* 3 5) 7)
    
Problem 3 (Tile):
    Use the DrRacket square, beside and above functions to create an image like this one:
        (four-quadrant square; blue in Q1&4, yellow in Q2&3)
    If you prefer to be more creative feel free to do so. You can use other DrRacket image 
    functions to make a more interesting or more attractive image.

    Solution 3:
        (beside (above (square 20 "solid" "blue")
                       (square 20 "solid" "yellow"))
                (above (square 20 "solid" "yellow")
                       (square 20 "solid" "blue")))

    Solution 3 Alternative:
        (define (sq c)
            (square 20 "solid" c))

        (beside (above (sq "blue")
                       (sq "yellow"))
                (above (sq "yellow")
                       (sq "blue")))

Problem 5 (Compare Images):
    Based on the two constants provided, write three expressions to determine whether: 
    1) IMAGE1 is taller than IMAGE2
    2) IMAGE1 is narrower than IMAGE2
    3) IMAGE1 has both the same width AND height as IMAGE2

        (define IMAGE1 (rectangle 10 15 "solid" "red"))
        (define IMAGE2 (rectangle 15 10 "solid" "red"))

    Solution 5:
        (> (image-height IMAGE1) 
           (image-height IMAGE2))

        (< (image-width IMAGE1) 
           (image-width IMAGE2))

        (and (= (image-width IMAGE1) 
                (image-width IMAGE2)) 
             (= (image-height IMAGE1) 
                (image-height IMAGE2)))

Problem 6 (More Foo Evaluation):
    Given the following function definition:
        (define (foo n)
            (* n n))
    Write out the step-by-step evaluation of the expression: 
        (foo (+ 3 4))
    Be sure to show every intermediate evaluation step.

    Solution 6:
        (foo (+ 3 4))
        (foo 7)
        (* 7 7)
        49

Problem 15 (Function Writing):
    Write a function that consumes two numbers and produces the larger of the two.

    Solution 15:
        (define (lerger x y)
            (if (> x y) x y))
